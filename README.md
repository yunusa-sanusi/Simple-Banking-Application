# Simple-Banking-Application
This is a project I completed from JetBrains Academy

The project performs some basic banking functionalities, it generate a card number and pin which the user can login with. The card number is generated using the luhn algorithm, so it generates a valid card that conforms with the industry standards. The generated card number is based on VISA card.
## Functionality
1. Users can login.
2. Users can transfer money to other accounts.
3. Users can close (delete) their account.
4. Users can check their balance.
5. Users can deposit money to their account.

The application stores it's data on a SQLite Database. So the data is persistent on a local machine.

I would like the code to be reviewed. I would like to know where I made bad code decisions. This is my second project on python.
Thanks for your help.
